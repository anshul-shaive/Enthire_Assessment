1. Loaded the data and converted class labels from positive and negative to binary and then performed
   some EDA. 

2. Converted the text reviews to numeric data using tokenizer.

3. Splitted the data between training, validation and test set.

4. Prepared datasets for training and testing by adding proper padding to the tokenized reviews.

5. Trained a Recurrent Neural Network model with Embedding, GRU and Dense layers.

    -->The RNN model gave training accuracy of 99% and testing accuracy of 90%.

5. Added BatchNormalization layers, reduced model complexity and used early stopping
   to deal with overfitting of training data.

6. Saved the model and tokenizer for api calls.

7. Finally tried BERT model using transformers library and trained it on the provided data.
   
    -->BERT model gave training accuracy of 99% and testing accuracy of 95%.
